# Leaf Classification

Classification
[competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification) hosted on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

* The [R notebook](r-kleafc.ipynb) explores the data and tries out a few
  classification approaches such as LDA, K-NN and Random Forests.
* The [Tensorflow notebook](tf-kleafc.ipynb) tries out a few neural nets
  for the same classification problem.

Note that the parameters used in the code are not necessarily optimal
for the competition. The goal here is just to play around with a few
different approaches.
